 you need to try to make a function that first figures out the
byte postions and assigns the label the byte postion in a hash table, it can do the math by just assuming 
that all labels are 32 bit adresss and counting forward this would work for forward refrence because on the second passes
instead of putting random 32 bits you get the binaray represntaiton of the adress and put that in there, then all we have to do is 
make sure that the instructions are a multiple of 8 and then have a function 
that splits it up in to vector of strings for each line then make a vector of vector of strings and just combine
it all together with an iterator counting for byte adress (this may be right or may be a bad method but if
it is right it can be used to help with doing the first pass function)
